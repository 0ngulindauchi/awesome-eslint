If you want to unlock all effects in FxGuru for Android without spending any money, you might be looking for a way to get a free unlock code. Unfortunately, there is no official way to do that. The developers of the app do not provide any codes or coupons for their users. Any website or app that claims to offer you a free unlock code for FxGuru is most likely a scam or a virus.

The prices vary depending on the effect and the pack. You can also watch ads or complete offers to earn free coins that you can use to buy some effects.
 
Alternatively, you can try to find a modded version of FxGuru that has all effects unlocked.

You may also lose your progress and data if you install a modded version of the app.
