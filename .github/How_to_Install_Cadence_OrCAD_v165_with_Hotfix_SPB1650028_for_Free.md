Before we start, you will need to download the following files from the internet:
 
- Cadence OrCAD v16.5 + Hotfix SPB16.50.028 | 2.81 GB
- Aspirin folder (contains crack files)

Once you have downloaded these files, follow these steps to install Cadence OrCAD v16.5 with Hotfix SPB16.50.028:

1. Install the license manager (License Manager) and program (Cadence SPB 16.5). Ignore and click next when a windows pops up asking for license file.
2. Copy the files in aspirin\Cadence\LicenseManager (i.e. pubkey.exe, pubkey, LicenseManager.cmd) to installed directory (e.g. C:\Cadence\LicenseManager). Run the LicenseManager.cmd.
3. Copy the files in aspirin\Cadence\SPB\_16.5\tools (i.e. pubkey.exe, pubkey, Tools.cmd) to installed directory (C:\Cadence\SPB\_16.5\tools). Run the Tools.cmd. The script may take up to several minutes to run.
4. Go to aspirin\Cadence\LicGen folder. Open the src.lic with a text editor (e.g. notepad). Change the "this-host" to your computer hostname, which can be identified using the following method "Start -> Run -> cmd -> ipconfig /all". Once done and saved, run the LicGen.cmd and a "license.lic" is created.
5. Open the License Server Configuration Utility (Start -> Programs -> Cadence -> License Manager -> License Server Configuration Utility). Locate the license.lic generated in Step-4 above.
6. Add a user environment variable (Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables) variable name : CDS\_LIC\_FILE variable value : C:\Cadence\LicenseManager\license.dat
7. Done and Enjoy!

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Cadence OrCAD v16.5 with Hotfix SPB16.50.028 for free. You can now use this software to design and simulate your electronic circuits.
